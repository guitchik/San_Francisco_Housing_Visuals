# Unit_6_Homework_Visuals
Python visuals using hvplot and geoviews

In this weeks assignment:

**Proptech**, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. Assume that youâ€™re an analyst at a proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.

Your job is to use your data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

You will find a Jupyter notebook that contains my analysis of the housing rental market data for San Francisco. The analysis will be complete with professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations using hvPlot and Geoviews.

### Analysis:
**Question:**  How does the trend in rental income growth compare to the trend in sales prices? Does this same trend hold true for all the neighborhoods across San Francisco?

**Answer:** # It seems like rental rates are sky rocketing, while sales prices seem to be holding ground and not rising in the same neighborhoods.  Whereas in neighborhoods where the rental rate hasn't increased as much, the sales prices have risen even more.


**Question:** What insights can you share with your company about the potential one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that they're pursuing? Do neighborhoods exist that you would suggest for investment, and why?

**Answer:** It seems the neighborhoods with the highest rental rate growth are not being sold and/or the supply is not growing in tandem with this growth.  These neighborhoods could use more investment and supply in some way.
